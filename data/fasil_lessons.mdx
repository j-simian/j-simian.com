# Fasil Lessons

## Introduction

To start, we will introduce the sounds of Fasil.

Fasil has 4 vowels, each of which sound similar to those found in Spanish. These are:

-   i • `/i/` • as in "beat" • as in "importancia"
-   a • `/a/` • as in "grass" • as in "adición"
-   e • `/e/` • as in "bet" • as in "escuchar"
-   u • `/u/` • as in "boot" • as in "unidad"

And there are 15 vowels, nearly all pronounced as their typical English sounds:

-   m • `/m/` • as in "meet"
-   n • `/n/` • as in "neat"
-   p • `/p/` • as in "pit"
-   b • `/b/` • as in "bit"
-   t • `/t/` • as in "tea"
-   d • `/d/` • as in "deer"
-   k • `/k/` • as in "keg"
-   g • `/g/` • as in "goo"
-   f • `/f/` • as in "full"
-   v • `/v/` • as in "vanish"
-   s • `/s/` • as in "size"
-   z • `/z/` • as in "zoo"
-   l • `/l/` • as in "land"
-   r • `/r/` • as in spanish "pero"
-   y • `/j/` • as in "yes"

This should be fairly simple for most English speakers, but what makes the phonology complex is the tones. Fasil uses a high and a low tone, with high tones marked by a macron on the vowels: ā, ē, ī, ū. The stress of the words falls on the last high tone in the word.

    sesī - hello

<p style="font-size: 48px; font-family: 'Fasil';" }}>sesi</p>

This should be pronounced seSI, where the second syllable is higher pitched and has the accent.
