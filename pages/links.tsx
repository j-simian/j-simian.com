      <blockquote>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>
          Create a list of bookmarks linking to websites you find interesting,
          and publish it for the world to see. It&apos;s a bit strange, almost
          nobody seems to be doing this. Looking through a sample of personal
          websites, very few of them has links to other personal websites. A
          hyperlink isn&apos;t a marriage proposal. It is enough to find some
          redeeming quality in a website to link to it. It costs nothing, and
          helps bring traffic to pages that you yourself think deserve it.
